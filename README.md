## These projects were carried out during kaggle competitions and data science training


### 1. RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification

You have to predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to train and test your model to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.

### 2. Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

You have to predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples.

### 3. Dog Breed Identification

With 120 dog breeds and a limited number of training images for each class, you need to create an algorithm that distinguishes dogs by breed

### 4. Mechanisms of Action (MoA) Prediction

You have to predicting multiple targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) response(s) of different samples (sig_id), given various inputs such as gene expression data and cell viability data.
