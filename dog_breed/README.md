You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal of the competition is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's bleed from a photo.
 
#### File descriptions
- train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs
- test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
- labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set
